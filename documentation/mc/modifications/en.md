# Modifications
***Modifications***, often shortened to just "mods", as a common term describing a piece of software intended to modify another piece of software, usually non-permanently.

## Clients
Clients are mods that heavily transform the game, providing modifications to the base game in drastic ways. These vary in purpose, which some clients providing better gameplay experiences (often called "PvP clients"), and some granting users with abilities that give them unfair advantages in gameplay (often called "hacked clients" or "utility clients").

The documented clients are as follows:
- [Lunar Client](modifications/lunar-client) - The most popular Minecraft PvP client.

## Loader Mods
Loader mods are a blanket term for any mod that is loaded using a dedicated tool, such as mods that use the [Forge Mod Loader](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) or [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC).

The documented mods are as follows:

## Independent Mods
Independent mods describe external modifications that are not categorized as clients (a rather arbitrary term). These often work through proxies or other forms of request hijacking.

The documented independent mods are as follows:

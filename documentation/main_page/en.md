# Main Page
Welcome to my little wiki. The entire wiki is open-source [here](https://github.com/Steviegt6/wiki), where you may contribute or write up issues regarding information.

The site that this is hosted on is open-sourced [here](https://github.com/Steviegt6/tomatophile), as well.

## Purpose
This wiki serves as a source of information for various projects of mine, as well as other games/projects not owned by me or that I am not associated with. Often, you'll find documentation of software (usually reverse-engineered proprietary software) or modding documentation for games such as [Terraria, using tModLoader](terraria).

## [Terraria](terraria)
Terraria is a sandbox RPG game by Re-Logic. There is a collection of modding resources and other useful information [here](terraria).

## [Minecraft](mc)
Minecraft is a popular sandbox adventure game with a rich modding community. Documented [here](mc) are numerous articles on modding and proprietary software (i.e. [Lunar Client](mc/modifications/lunar-client)) associated with the game/.
